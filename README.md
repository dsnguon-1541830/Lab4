# Lab 4
The Tile sets in this map are set as a monochromatic design to be able to show data points clearly and the color is set to a clear gray. The geogrphic area which I have selected to center the map on is the United States of America and the zoom is set to 4 to be able to show all of the country on the map. The max zoom is set to 5 and the min zoom is set to 0 because the map is designed to only show as far as state details and be able to detail the world map clearly.
